# Educational Math Chatbot with OpenAI and WolframAlpha
This project aims to create a math chatbot powered by OpenAI's GPT model, integrated with Dialogflow and WolframAlpha's computational engine. 

OpenAI's GPT model is an artificial intelligence language model with the ability to understand and generate human-like text. One example of OpenAI's GPT model is ChatGPT. 

Wolfram Alpha is a computational knowledge engine designed to answer factual queries and perform computations based on a wide range of topics.

Our chatbot will be powered by OpenAI's GPT model, enabling the chatbot to understand complex queries and generate human-like responses. Integrating it with the WolframAlpha will allow the chatbot to accurately solve complex mathematical problems.
