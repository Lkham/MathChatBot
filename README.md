# Educational Math Chatbot with OpenAI and WolframAlpha
This project aims to develop an intelligent math chatbot, combining the power of OpenAI's GPT model with Dialogflow and WolframAlpha's computational engine.

OpenAI's GPT is a cutting-edge artificial intelligence language model capable of understanding and generating human-like text. A well-known example of this technology is ChatGPT, which demonstrates GPT's ability to engage in meaningful conversations and respond to a wide range of queries.

WolframAlpha, on the other hand, is a powerful computational knowledge engine designed to answer factual questions and perform complex computations across various domains.

By harnessing OpenAI's GPT model, our chatbot is able to understand complex user queries and deliver natural, human-like responses. Integrating WolframAlpha's computational capabilities empowers the chatbot to solve advanced mathematical problems with precision, making it a robust tool for users seeking both conversational interaction and accurate solutions.

As demonstrated in the demo above, when we test the same mathematical question in ChatGPT and WolframAlpha separately, they function differently. ChatGPT offers an explanation but doesn't generate a graph, while WolframAlpha struggles to interpret the user input unless specifically asked to plot the graph. In that case, it provides the exact same result as our bot.

This is because WolframAlpha focuses on computational knowledge, while GPT models are designed to handle a wide range of natural language tasks. Their purposes differ, but when combined, our bot can understand complex user queries, generate relevant responses, and accurately solve advanced mathematical problems.
