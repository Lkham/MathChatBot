# Educational Math Chatbot with OpenAI and WolframAlpha
This project seeks to develop an intelligent math chatbot, combining the power of OpenAI's GPT model with Dialogflow and WolframAlpha's computational engine.

OpenAI's GPT is a cutting-edge artificial intelligence language model capable of understanding and generating human-like text. A well-known example of this technology is ChatGPT, which showcases GPT's ability to engage in sophisticated conversations and respond to a wide variety of queries.

WolframAlpha, on the other hand, is a renowned computational knowledge engine designed to answer factual questions and perform intricate computations across various domains.

By harnessing OpenAI's GPT model, our chatbot will excel at comprehending complex user queries and delivering natural, human-like responses. Integrating WolframAlpha's computational capabilities will empower the chatbot to solve advanced mathematical problems with precision, making it a robust tool for users seeking both conversational interaction and accurate solutions.
